- Autoprefixer is a promise...
- Module sass/js/react/jquery, should just AddFile function when I check if they exist.
- Have to do odd things to get the names of the uikit modules to match the values received in the form... doesn't feel like a pure function...
- Need to push `response` into the last function...
